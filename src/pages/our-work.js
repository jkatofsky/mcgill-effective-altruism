                    <h3>Effective Altruism Fellowship</h3>
                    <p>A couple times per year, we run an effective altruism fellowship. Each week during the program, the cohort of fellows will read about a certain topic within effective altruism and then meets to discuss it.</p>

                    <p>In the process, fellows gain access to guest speakers/professors and confront moral questions alongside a group of intelligent and open-minded individuals. At the end of the fellowship, the fellows collectively decide on a charity to which they want to donate.</p>

                    <p>Applications are open for the Summer 2022 fellowship alongside <a href="https://uwea.org/" target="_blank">EA University of Washington</a>.

Occaisonally, we will invite guest speakers as well!

In the meantime, we will mail you the books.
